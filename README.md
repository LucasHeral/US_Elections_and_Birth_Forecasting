# US Elections and Birth Forecasting

This project dealt with two independant topics which are the US election opposing Obama and Clinton in 2008 and on the other side the prediction of births in the US to predict the demand for beds in hospitals.
You can find two R scripts related to these respective topics and one pdf where you will find an interpretation of the models built as well as recommandations based on the results of the models.
